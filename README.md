Financial Record Analysis

This assignment was done in order to analyze financial records to determine total & monthly profits and losses.

Python was used to read in data from a CSV file and then loop through the records to extract monthly profit & loss values in order to list:
-total months, 
-total change in value,
-average monthly change,
-greatest increase in profits,
-greatest decrease in profits

The analysis printed the results to the terminal and exported the text file with the results.
