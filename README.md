Financial Record Analysis

This assignment was done in order to analyze financial records to determine total & monthly profits and losses.

Python was used to read in data from a CSV file and then loop through the records to extract monthly profit & loss values in order to list:
-total months<br />
-total change in value<br />
-average monthly change<br />
-greatest increase in profits<br />
-greatest decrease in profits

The analysis printed the results to the terminal and exported the text file with the results.
